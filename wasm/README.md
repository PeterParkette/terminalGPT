## CREATING WASM TERMINAL

It is possible to use Rust and WebAssembly (Wasm) to run a terminal emulator in a web browser. One way to do this is to use the Rust library called "wezterm" which provides a terminal emulator written in Rust.

To use wezterm in the browser, you would need to compile it to WebAssembly using the Rust toolchain and then load the resulting module in a web page. You can use a tool like "wasm-pack" to build the Rust code as a Wasm module.

Once you have the wezterm Wasm module, you can load it in a web page using JavaScript. You would need to create a canvas element in the HTML where the terminal emulator will be rendered, and then use JavaScript to create an instance of the wezterm module and render it to the canvas.

Here's an example of how to do this:

1. Install the required tools:

Rust toolchain (<https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>)
wasm-pack (<https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/>)

2. Create a new Rust project using the cargo command-line tool:

`wasm-pack new terminal-wasm`

1. Add package to run terminal on browser:

```rust
[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.74"
```

1. Write Rust code to create a new instance of the terminal emulator and render it to a canvas element:

```rust


```

5.Build the Rust project as a Wasm module using wasm-pack:

```rust
wasm-pack build --target web --out-name index --out-dir ./dist
```

6. Create an HTML file with a canvas element to render the terminal emulator:

```html

```

7. Serve the HTML file and the Wasm module using a web server, or open the HTML file directly in a web browser.
